# EV_Charging_Staition_Availability
Project Description: EV Charging Station Availability Prediction This project aims to build a predictive system that forecasts the availability of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations using a Deep Learning-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. 
# ‚ö° EV Charging Station Availability Prediction

This project uses a Deep Learning model to predict the availability of EV charging stations in the future using historical data and intelligent pattern recognition.
